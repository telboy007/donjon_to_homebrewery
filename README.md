# donjon_to_homebrewery
Converts [donjon](https://donjon.bin.sh) random dungeons into nice homebrewery v3 formatted text to copy and paste.  It will add page markers to break up room locations, but some minor edits may still be required to the final document.

## Features
* Uses AI to enhance the dungeon flavour text, suggest a boss and lair details, and adds two adventure hooks.
* Adds any monster stat blocks that exist in the SRD to the document and lists the ones it had to skip (5e only)
* Collects all the monsters and magical items into easy to use reference tables with sourcebook page number (5e, 4e limited)
* Provides total XP and a breakdown of combat encounter difficulty types (5e only, 4e limited)
* Adds page breaks throughout the document regardless of ruleset to reduce amount of manual editing required
* Captures all the settings used to generate this dungeon on donjon.bin.sh for prosperity
* Ability to customise certain parts of room locations so important details aren't missed

This tool has been tested with:
1. AD&D
1. D&D 4e
1. D&D 5e

NOTE: don't forget to grab both maps (gm and player) from donjon as well as the json! :)

## Using GitHub Actions

Using the GitHub action enables AI enhancements, enjoy.

NOTE: filename, gm map and player map are all required fields when using the github action.

1. Scroll to the bottom to find the Hombrewery.txt file under `Aftifacts`

**IMPORTANT: Creating download link for google drive

1. Make the json file shareable with anyone with the link with viewer rights (make sure viewers can download files via settings)
1. Copy link which will look like: https://drive.google.com/file/d/111111AAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBB/view?usp=sharing

1. Create this link: https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=111111AAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBB
1. Enter this URL in the github action workflow filename field
