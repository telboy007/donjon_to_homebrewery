# donjon_to_homebrewery
Converts [donjon](https://donjon.bin.sh) random dungeons into nice homebrewery v3 formatted text to copy and paste.  It will add page markers to break up room locations, but some minor edits may still be required to the final document.

This tool has been tested with:
1. AD&D
1. D&D 4e
1. D&D 5e

NOTE: don't forget to grab both maps (gm and player) from donjon as well as the json! :)

To install:
1. Clone repo
1. Copy json from donjon into repo folder
1. cd into repo
1. `pip install pipenv`
1. `pipenv shell` (NOTE: you may need to install pyenv to install python 3.8)

To run:
1. Supplied help text explains arguments needed to run the command
```
positional arguments:
  filename

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -gm GM_MAP, --gm_map GM_MAP
                        URL for the GM Map image
  -p PLAYER_MAP, --player_map PLAYER_MAP
                        URL for the Player map image
```
1. If you have the GM and Player maps, host them on an image hosting site and add the urls as arguments
1. `python convert_donjon_to_homebrewery.py your_filename.json -gm https://imgur.something.png -p https://imgur.something.png`

You can now copy and paste the contents of homebrewery.txt into your [homebrewery](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/) document.
